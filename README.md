# 🖥️ Personal Infrastructure

This repository contains the configuration, services, and automation I use to manage my personal infrastructure.  
Everything is primarily managed through **Dockploy** with Docker/Docker Compose as the foundation.  

The goal is to keep all sysadmin-related work **versioned, documented, and reproducible** — so I can rebuild or expand my environment quickly.
